# NCCL in LLM Inference

NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library) fits into multi-GPU distributed inference - it's the communication backbone for scaling LLM inference across multiple GPUs

Where NCCL Fits:
Single GPU: Your model runs entirely on one GPU
Input → GPU → Model → Output

Multi-GPU with NCCL: Large model split across GPUs
Input → GPU0 (layers 1-6) → NCCL → GPU1 (layers 7-12) → NCCL → GPU2 (layers 13-18) → Output

Why You Need It:
Large models (70B+ parameters) don't fit on single GPU
NCCL optimizes GPU-to-GPU communication (10x faster than alternatives)
Enables parallelism strategies (model, tensor, pipeline parallelism)

## What is NCCL?

**NVIDIA Collective Communications Library** - Optimized communication primitives for multi-GPU operations.

## Where NCCL Fits in LLM Inference

### 1. **Model Parallelism** (Most Common)
When your model is too large for a single GPU:

```python
# Example: GPT-3 175B parameters across 8 GPUs
# Each GPU holds different layers

import torch
import torch.distributed as dist

# Initialize NCCL backend
dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl', rank=gpu_id, world_size=8)

class DistributedGPT:
    def __init__(self, rank, world_size):
        self.rank = rank
        self.world_size = world_size
        
        # Each GPU gets different layers
        if rank == 0:
            self.layers = model.layers[0:6]    # Layers 0-5
        elif rank == 1:
            self.layers = model.layers[6:12]   # Layers 6-11
        # ... etc
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Process through local layers
        x = self.layers(x)
        
        # Send to next GPU using NCCL
        if self.rank < self.world_size - 1:
            dist.send(x, dst=self.rank + 1)
        
        if self.rank > 0:
            dist.recv(x, src=self.rank - 1)
        
        return x
```

### 2. **Tensor Parallelism**
Split individual operations across GPUs:

```python
# Split attention computation across GPUs
class DistributedAttention:
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, world_size):
        self.world_size = world_size
        self.heads_per_gpu = num_heads // world_size
        
        # Each GPU handles subset of attention heads
        self.local_attention = MultiHeadAttention(
            d_model, 
            d_model, 
            num_heads=self.heads_per_gpu
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Each GPU computes its attention heads
        local_output = self.local_attention(x)
        
        # Gather all outputs using NCCL all-gather
        all_outputs = [torch.zeros_like(local_output) for _ in range(self.world_size)]
        dist.all_gather(all_outputs, local_output)
        
        # Concatenate results
        return torch.cat(all_outputs, dim=-1)
```

### 3. **Pipeline Parallelism**
Different stages of the model on different GPUs:

```python
# GPU 0: Embedding + Layers 0-5
# GPU 1: Layers 6-11  
# GPU 2: Layers 12-17
# GPU 3: Final layers + Output head

class PipelineStage:
    def __init__(self, stage_id, layers):
        self.stage_id = stage_id
        self.layers = layers
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Process through stage layers
        x = self.layers(x)
        
        # Send to next stage
        if self.stage_id < 3:  # Not last stage
            dist.send(x, dst=self.stage_id + 1)
        
        return x
```

## NCCL Operations in LLM Inference

### **All-Reduce** (Most Important)
Combine results from all GPUs:

```python
# Example: Combining gradients or logits
def all_reduce_logits(local_logits):
    # Each GPU has partial logits, combine them
    dist.all_reduce(local_logits, op=dist.ReduceOp.SUM)
    return local_logits / world_size
```

### **All-Gather**
Collect data from all GPUs:

```python
# Example: Gathering attention outputs
def gather_attention_outputs(local_output):
    gathered = [torch.zeros_like(local_output) for _ in range(world_size)]
    dist.all_gather(gathered, local_output)
    return torch.cat(gathered, dim=-1)
```

### **Broadcast**
Send data from one GPU to all others:

```python
# Example: Broadcasting input tokens to all GPUs
def broadcast_input(input_tokens, src_rank=0):
    dist.broadcast(input_tokens, src=src_rank)
    return input_tokens
```

## Real-World Usage Examples

### **vLLM with NCCL**
```python
# vLLM automatically uses NCCL for multi-GPU
from vllm import LLM

# This automatically distributes across available GPUs using NCCL
llm = LLM(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf",
    tensor_parallel_size=8,  # Use 8 GPUs
    # NCCL handles communication automatically
)
```

### **TensorRT-LLM with NCCL**
```python
# TensorRT-LLM configuration
import tensorrt_llm

# Multi-GPU engine with NCCL
engine = tensorrt_llm.ModelRunner.from_dir(
    engine_dir="/path/to/engine",
    rank=gpu_rank,
    world_size=8,
    # NCCL backend configured automatically
)
```

### **DeepSpeed with NCCL**
```python
import deepspeed

# DeepSpeed uses NCCL for model parallelism
ds_config = {
    "train_batch_size": 32,
    "tensor_parallel": {"tp_size": 8},  # 8-way tensor parallelism
    "pipeline_parallel": {"pp_size": 4}  # 4-way pipeline parallelism
}

model_engine = deepspeed.initialize(
    model=model,
    config=ds_config
    # NCCL handles all inter-GPU communication
)
```

## Performance Impact

### **Communication Patterns**
```python
# High-bandwidth operations (good for NCCL)
- All-reduce: O(n) bandwidth usage
- All-gather: O(n) bandwidth usage

# Point-to-point operations (less optimal)
- Send/Recv: Can create bottlenecks
```

### **Optimization Tips**
```python
# 1. Minimize communication frequency
# Bad: Communicate every layer
for layer in layers:
    x = layer(x)
    dist.all_reduce(x)  # Too frequent!

# Good: Communicate in chunks
chunk_outputs = []
for i, layer in enumerate(layers):
    x = layer(x)
    if i % 4 == 0:  # Every 4 layers
        chunk_outputs.append(x)

# Batch communication
for output in chunk_outputs:
    dist.all_reduce(output)

# 2. Overlap computation and communication
with torch.cuda.stream(comm_stream):
    dist.all_reduce(prev_output)  # Async communication
    
current_output = model_layer(input)  # Computation overlaps
```

## Integration with Your Server

### **Multi-GPU Inference Server**
```python
class MultiGPUInferenceServer:
    def __init__(self, model_path, world_size):
        # Initialize NCCL
        dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl')
        
        # Load model shards
        self.model_shard = self.load_model_shard(model_path)
        
    async def generate_distributed(self, prompts):
        # Distribute prompts across GPUs
        local_prompts = self.shard_prompts(prompts)
        
        # Each GPU processes its shard
        local_outputs = await self.model_shard.generate(local_prompts)
        
        # Gather results using NCCL
        all_outputs = self.gather_outputs(local_outputs)
        
        return all_outputs
```

## When You Need NCCL

### **You DON'T need NCCL if:**
- Single GPU inference
- CPU-only inference  
- Small models that fit on one GPU
- Using pre-built inference servers (they handle it)

### **You DO need NCCL if:**
- Model > GPU memory (70B+ parameter models)
- Building custom multi-GPU inference
- Optimizing large-scale serving
- Research on distributed inference

## Key Takeaway

**NCCL is the "networking layer" for multi-GPU LLM inference.** It's like the internet for GPUs - enabling them to efficiently share data when running large models that don't fit on a single GPU.

For your current setup (single CPU), you don't need NCCL. But when you scale to multiple GPUs for large models, NCCL becomes essential for performance.
